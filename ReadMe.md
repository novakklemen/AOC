# Advent of Code 2024 - C# Solutions

Welcome to my solutions repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges! This repository contains my implementations in C#, structured for clarity. Each day's puzzle is solved in two parts, and my solutions follow a consistent format for easy navigation.

## Repository Structure

```
2024/
│
├── DecNN/                 # Folder for each day's solutions (e.g., Dec01, Dec02, ...)
│   ├── Part1.cs           # Solution for Part 1 of the day's puzzle
│   ├── Part2.cs           # Solution for Part 2 of the day's puzzle
│   ├── input.txt          # Puzzle input for the day

├── README.md              # This file
└── .gitignore             # Standard Git ignore file
```

- **`DecNN`**: Each day's folder (e.g., `Dec01`, `Dec02`, etc.) contains the solutions for that day.
- **`Part1.cs` and `Part2.cs`**: Each part has its own C# file, containing the logic encapsulated within the `Execute` method.
- **`input.txt`**: The input provided by Advent of Code for the day's challenge.
